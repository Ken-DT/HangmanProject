Hangman Game in Node.js

Welcome to the Hangman game, implemented in Node.js! This is a simple command-line version of the classic word-guessing game. The player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
Features

    Random word selection from a predefined list.
    The player can guess one letter at a time.
    The game tracks and displays guessed letters, the number of guesses left, and the current state of the word.
    Playable in any terminal that supports Node.js.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    You must have Node.js installed on your computer.
    The readline-sync package is required to run this game. It will be installed as part of the setup process.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-nodejs.git
cd hangman-nodejs

    Install dependencies:

bash

npm install

This will install readline-sync among any other dependencies your game might require.
Running the Game

To start the game, run:

bash

node index.js

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. The game will prompt you to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, you lose a guess. The game ends when you correctly guess the word or run out of guesses.
How to Play

    After starting the game, you will see a series of underscores representing the letters of a randomly selected word.
    Type a letter you think might be in the word and press Enter.
    If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
    If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one of your limited guesses.
    The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.
